## Gameplay

### Landing Page
Upon loading the page, you will be presented with the start page. Press start to begin!

### The Quiz
After pressing start, the container holding the start button will toggle off and the container holding questions will appear with your first question.

You'll notice a score and time countdown. You have 60 seconds to get through 10 multiple choice questions. Once you select your answer, a next button will be toggled to appear at the bottom of the container. If you're sure about your selection, press next. If your selection is correct, your score will increase by 10. If your selection is incorrect, you will lose 5 seconds from the countdown.

Once you've answered all 10 questions or if time runs out, the game will end.

### Results Page
When the game ends, you'll be brought to the results page, displaying your score at the top. Input your name to store your score at the bottom of the page!

The assignment was to build an interactive quiz that validates the user's answer selections by implementing a score count and timer. It was also required that the user would be able to save their score in local storage. I enjoyed this assignment very much. It was tricky and challenging given my minimal experience using JavaScript. The challenges within this assignment pushed me to further my understanding of many concepts and forced me to approach things with logic that doesn't always come naturally.
